Welcome to the Grasslands!

Meet your protagonists: Kitsu, the woodland fox, and Tama, the bluebird not quite ready to leave her shell. After finding Tama alone on the forest floor, Kitsu took Tama under his wing; with the two being as close as family, Tama joins the woodland critters in a life of peace and happiness.

However, dark spirits are rising; as chaos grows in power, the evil witch Grimmhilda hates the peace the Grasslands has endured for so long and curses the Grasslands. Now, Kitsu and Tama are stranded in two mirror dimensions and must fight to restore the Grasslands and reunite.

Explore the cryptic puzzles placed within the mirror dimensions and use the friendly witch Glenda's portals to travel back and forth to fight your way to Grimmhilda. But be warned! Many dark enemies are rising from the nether, and Grimmhilda's curse prevents the two from allying together for too long...
