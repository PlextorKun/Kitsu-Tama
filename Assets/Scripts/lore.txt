Waking in a forest dreary,
The fox and egg lie weak and weary,
Challenges they must face as enemies rise from the nether
To reunite they will be tested, isolated, yet together.

Only mystical portals will let them be freed,
One must control so the other can proceed.
But a curse has been placed to add to their plight,
Death will follow if for too long they reunite.

With the two cast adrift,
Their friendship will be their primary gift.
To the forest they must bring peace, 
And only then can the curse cease.
